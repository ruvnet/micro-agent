    Here is a design I am trying to make my code match (attached image). Currently, its not quite right.

    Ignore placeholder images (gray boxes), those are intentional when present and will be fixed later.

    Here's some examples of things that are wrong between the code and image that need fixing.
    Fix any other discrepancies you see too. I want the code to match the design as closely as possible.
    Prompt:
    {visual_test_result or 'Make the code match the original design as close as possible.'}

    The current code is:
    {prior_code or 'None'}

    If the updates to the code are substantial, it's ok to completely rewrite the code from scratch.

    Here are additional instructions from the user:
    {prompt or 'None provided'}

    The file path for the above is {options['outputFile']}.

    # Logic to handle the generation based on the prompt and images goes here
    # This is a simplified placeholder for the actual implementation

    return {
        'code': prior_code,  # This should be replaced with the generated code
        'testResult': 'fail'  # This should be updated based on the generation success
    }
